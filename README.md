# Running the app

To run the app, you must initiate 2 consoles in the phone-catalog folder.

In one of them run:  
npm run server.

In the other one run:  
npm start

With the first command, the REST API will start running, and with the second the React App is started and a tab
will be launched in your browser with it.
